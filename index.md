## [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/) (April 2019 - )

The Standard for Public Code gives public organizations a model for building their own open source solutions to enable successful future reuse by other public organizations. It includes guidance for policymakers, managers, developers and designers.

This is a living document, and [we welcome all your feedback](http://standard.publiccode.net/CONTRIBUTING.html).

## [Smart Cities? Public Code!](https://smartcities.publiccode.net/) (February 2018 - April 2019)

This project aimed to further develop the concept of public code. More concretely: How should we understand public code, and how can we create it? What kind of technological and institutional arrangements are needed to shift towards the production of public code?

In a series of workshops, we built a network of collaborators to identify directions for the development of public code, and set up research and development projects and grant applications.

[Smart Cities? Public Code!](https://smartcities.publiccode.net/) was a collaboration between the City of Amsterdam, the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and Vurb.Agency.
